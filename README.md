### What is supply in Door Kickers 2?
Supply in DK2 determines how many of the little round icons in the top right corner of the deployment screen one of you soldiers takes.

It is set from 0 to 100 for one icon, and values like 25, 50 and 75, being a quarter, half and three quarters. These values are also visually represented in the icon in-game.

Values over 100 (like 125, 150, 3, 775) are possible but maps may not be designed to handle them, so you might not have enough soldiers.

Non-Standard values (like 12, 65, 39) are also possible and function the same as standard values. For example, a 12 value soldier and an 88 value Soldier will Occupie only one icon. But the game doesnt visually show the values in-game. It just shows the icon for 25/50/75/100 (and extrapolations of them like 150/125/375).
