# DK2 EasySupplySetter v1.0.0
A simple and easy to use program to change the supply values for modded units in Door Kickers 2.

### How to use
The program is portable, so no installation is needed. Just drop it in your DK2 Workshop folder and run it.
The Workshop folder is found in your Steam Library Folder under *\steamapps\workshop\content\1239080*

It will ask which value to use, and once you confirm it changes all supply values for all units that you downloaded from the Steam Workshop.
It also shows you all the files that it modifies.

### What is supply in Door Kickers 2?
Supply in DK2 determines how many of the little round icons in the top right corner of the deployment screen one of you soldiers takes.

It is set from 0 to 100 for one icon, and values like 25, 50 and 75, being a quarter, half and three quarters. These values are also visually represented in the icon in-game.

Values over 100 (like 125, 150, 3, 775) are possible but maps may not be designed to handle them, so you might not have enough soldiers.

Non-Standard values (like 12, 65, 39) are also possible and function the same as standard values. For example, a 12 value soldier and an 88 value Soldier will Occupie only one icon. But the game doesnt visually show the values in-game. It just shows the icon for 25/50/75/100 (and extrapolations of them like 150/125/375).
