# DK2_EasySupplySetter
A simple and easy to use program to change the supply values for modded units in Door Kickers 2.

### How to use
The program is portable, so no installation is needed. Just drop it in your DK2 Workshop folder and run it.
The Workshop folder is found in your Steam Library Folder under *\steamapps\workshop\content\1239080*

It will ask which value to use, and once you confirm it changes all supply values for all units that you downloaded from the Steam Workshop.
It also shows you all the files that it modifies.
